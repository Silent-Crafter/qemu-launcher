# QEMU-Launcher

A simple (very basic) launcher for qemu-cli. Why not use virt-manager you ask? Umm idk. I used that too but i guess i find this handy.
Also i cant use Intel GVT-g with virt-manager. The xml options are deprecated and give error

# Usage
Do
```bash
chmod +x
./qemu.sh --help
```
Read that shit. Its not that big and complicated. I am tired to copy paste all that here.
If you have a qemu.conf file then just execute the program :)

# Dependencies
- qemu (duh)
- util-linux
